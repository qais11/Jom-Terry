<p class="about-title">Jom and Terry</p></br>
<p>
In this project , I decided to do somthing difrrent , and use or learn a new library .</br>
It was fun to work with <em>PIXI.js</em> , Great library and easy to use as soon as you understand how it works.</br>
Visual stuff was always my passion and still. <br>
In this project , I used <em>Angular.js</em> framework in order to create a single page App.</br>
I used the <em>derictives</em> to use a block of code in a diffrent places without repeating my self. </br>
-<em>JQury</em> was used in some places in the project (In the directive's Link functions).  </br>
- all the photos, logos and characters in the project were modified by using <em>PhotoShop</em>.</br>
  .....</br>
  In the back-end side i used my own database and <em>API</em> to store and call the user's heigh score by using <em>SQL</em>.</br>
  Users can use their <em>FACEBOOK</em> accounts to stor their high score </br>
  or they can play the game as guests .. and in that case users will see the highest score , which has been made by other guests</br>
  ...... </br>
  all the server-side stuff were done by using <em>NODE.JS</em>.</br>


  <em>Jom and Terry</em> project is for educational purposes</br>
  and the characters are copies of the famous <em>Tom & Jerry</em> Cartoon.

  In order to help us learn and love coding.
